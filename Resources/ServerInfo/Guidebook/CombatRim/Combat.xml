# Combat

Unfortunately, people you will come across here won't be too friendly. It's almost impossible to monitor the entire place safely so no one has decided to implement laws inside of them. Therefore you're going to have to be the justice that the sectors need. That or you'll join them, I won't judge if you couldn't beat them.

This section of my notes will cover how to fight against them and what methods of combat you have at your disposal. My closing words for this page is: Trust no-one, put your survival above others and if needed, always make the first strike!
