# The Sector's economy
Believe it or not, there are people in this hell that are still trying to make a profit out of everyone misery. I guess it isn't that different to the world outside... Thankfully, they are also open to buying stuff from you! Problem is that they only have so much money to work with, and they bound to run out soon...

## Random Factors
Every now and then, some stuff may happen to the banks that hold the overall economy together. Everything from raiders to the casual printing of money, anything is possible. These will affect the value of the currency, which in the sectors will always be spacebucks... for some reason. It's an odd coincidence that may never be explained, however does keep things simple at least...

## Buying
Any ships that the sector shoves you in will likely contain a vendor of sorts. Somehow, the bank people have somehow managed to connect these up to their banks, so they can directly sell their goods to you. These may have some valuable stuff in them, and you may never see it anywhere else! However it also may contain a few important things that help your ship run, so be sure to check it out.

## Selling
Any ship that contains a vendor also likely contain a sell pad, powered by redspace. They are unable to transfer living cargo, as redspace kills anything that tries to live in it for too long, however it's still hooked up to the banks. In order to use them, simply place anything above it and activate it with a signal. The item placed ontop will instantly disappear and in it's place will be money, equal to the value of the item inserted... well not really there's a small tax and no, you can't evade them!
