# Welcome

If you're reading this, that means that my attempt at trying to send you this worked!

You may be curious about my name. I personally don't feel comfortable revealing it and it won't really be important. What does matter is your survival, as any data you can bring to us will be important, and since you're stuck there for now, you might aswell as you have nothing to gain from not doing so. I will assist with teaching you the important things of the anomally you're in, what you should do and the tools at your disposal. Good luck, stay safe and remember: you're not alone, so be prepared for anything.
