# The sectors

So you may be wondering: "Gee, how did I end up here?"
And if you are asking that question, then you must've hit your head pretty hard. But you're probably like the majority. You were at the wrong place at the wrong time. You couldn't have known, no one could've.

But, casting that aside, a more important question would be: "Where the hell am I?"
Well, no one knows, but some are calling it a "death sector", and for a good reason! You try to get out, you die. You try to get in, you die, but I guess you do eventually get in.
Some people who have managed to get in have told us that it's an "anomally", and that they've been appearing quite a bit. It's hard to say how many there are, but there are definitely a noticable amount of them because people HAVE noticed.

Well, I guess it's better than being stuck inside of a singularity. No one has been reported to escape those alive.
