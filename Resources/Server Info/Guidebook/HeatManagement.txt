All machinery and equipment produces heat, about equal to it's power requirements (A 150W computer produces about 150W of heat). It is important to ensure that this excess heat gets dissipated into space to ensure crew comfort and ultimately crew safety. This is most commonly done using thermal pumps (easily constructed, basic power requirements) and Frezon (hard to obtain but incredibly effective, capable of counteracting large fires and large arrays of high-wattage machinery.)

Standard thermal pumps are powerful for rapidly transferring heat between rooms and dissipating up to 395 watts of heat into space per unit, however, being wall mounted machinery, they require sufficient surface area to function and may be difficult to work into some layouts.

Frezon is a consumable gas that, when mixed with 5 parts N2 for every 1 part Frezon, consumes vast amounts of heat energy. Due to it's rarity it is not typically a long-term heat management plan but it is highly effective. It is also the only practical way to counter a burn mix leak without discarding room contents into space.
