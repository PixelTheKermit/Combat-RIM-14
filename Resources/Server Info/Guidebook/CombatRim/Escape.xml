# Escaping the sectors.

Every now and then, a very sturdy shuttle, capable of very fast transport is sent to some of the sectors. Well I say every now and then, but it usually feels like 2-5 months between each shuttle, due to how expensive it is. This usually causes most people to fight eachother over it, hoping to leave this hell asap. However this isn't the catalyst for why most people decide to kill eachother here.
The FTL prototype shuttle, it hurts like hell, but it gets it's job done. If you want to escape, that is your best chance at doing it. There are no better alternatives, you either stay stuck in hell, or you make a sacrifice.
Some people don't want to escape, claiming that the life they got in the sectors is better than back at home. To those, I couldn't care less, if it makes them happy and it doesn't hurt anyone, then they're free to do so...

... heh, "free".
