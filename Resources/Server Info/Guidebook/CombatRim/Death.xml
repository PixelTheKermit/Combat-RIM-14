# Death

So if you're reading this. You most likely know how in here, you can't really die. Your soul remembers everything that happened before you died, and it will transfer over to a new body that's simillar to the one you had, but without the wounds. Feels weird though.

It also appears that people who do die here can sometimes be transported to other sectors, which means they are connected somehow. We're still unsure how but we're trying to look into it.

## Ghosts

If your will is strong enough, you may be able to see the world outside your body, which sounds cool at first but then you realize you can't really do much apart from see and hear everything, and I mean EVERYTHING in the sector, no matter where you are. Thank god your ghost ears can't go deaf.

If you've decided to give up being a ghost, you can give in to your tired eyes and go sleep, you've earned your rest. 

You'll wake up soon, cold and most likely alone.

Good luck once you do.
