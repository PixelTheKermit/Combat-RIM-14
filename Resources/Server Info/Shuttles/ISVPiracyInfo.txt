Arr! Piracy be a crime, y'know!
This once used by space pirates ship was converted into a service ship that includes a small botanical, 
chef and bartending area at the front. It is also meant to be run on food, so ensure you have a good crew 
that know the basics of botany and cooking before purchasing this ship. It comes with 4 laser turrets, located at 
the near end of the ship, used to fight off intruders.
