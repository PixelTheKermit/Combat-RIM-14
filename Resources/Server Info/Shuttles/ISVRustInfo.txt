The Rust resembles a sub, made hastily and cheaply to traverse high pressures.
It is said that this sub was made for traversing "blood moons", however we don't
know if those actually exist. No turrets, so no defence. The wiring is fucked, 
you will need to fix it up. It's only big enough to store one person on board.
Runs on uranium, so fueling this up will be hard. It's also prone to leaks in oxygen, 
so it may not be livable for oxygen intakers. Only good for those seeking a challenge.
